# Smart Water Management System

## Overview

The **Smart Water Management System** is a Python-based solution for simulating, managing, and optimizing water usage through real-time data and machine learning techniques. It integrates **real-time water level monitoring**, **flow rate simulation**, and **predictive modeling** to help in intelligent decision-making for water conservation.

By utilizing **Python**, **Flask**, **Machine Learning**, and **Matplotlib**, this project simulates water management in smart environments and provides insights for optimization.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Simulate and track water levels and flow rates continuously.
- **Water Level Prediction**: Predict future water levels based on historical data using **Linear Regression**.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Detect unusual water flow behaviors that may indicate system issues or inefficiencies.
- **Data Visualization**: Display real-time graphs and charts using **Matplotlib** and **Chart.js** for water levels and flow rates.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Implement **scikit-learn** for water level prediction and anomaly detection.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - **Python**: Main language for data simulation, machine learning models, and backend logic.
  - **Flask**: Web framework for serving the application and handling requests.
  - **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations and data generation.
  - **Matplotlib**: For static data visualizations (graphs).
  - **scikit-learn**: To implement machine learning models like **Linear Regression** for water level prediction.
  - **Chart.js**: For frontend data visualization (interactive charts).

- **Machine Learning**:
  - **Linear Regression**: To predict water levels based on flow rates.
  - **Anomaly Detection**: Detect any unusual activity or errors in the water flow system.
